        <h2>Rehoboth Beach, DE</h2>

        <p>The first destination my family and I visited was <a href="https://www.cityofrehoboth.com/">Rehoboth Beach, 
            Delaware</a>. Rehoboth Beach is a great family beach and the first beach my youngest daughter had ever been to. We snacked on the famous boardwalk fries from <a href="http://thrashersfries.com/">Thrasher's</a>.
             After building sand castles, dipping in the ocean, and getting some
              sun we grabbed icecream cones and walked on the boardwalk. We had a day in the sun with ocean breezes, what a great time!</p>

        <h2>Assateague Island, MD</h2>
        <img src= "C:\Users\nicol\lc101\html-me-something\images\19990217_10210317094665778_1966932606806963602_n.jpg" alt="horse" height="600" width="400">
        <p>My family and I went to see the wild horses of <a href= "https://www.nps.gov/asis/index.htm/index.htm">Assateague Island
             National Seashore</a> in Maryland. The horses swim from the mainland
              to the island in early spring and swim back to the mainland in
               the fall. You can relax on the white sandy beaches and have 
               wild horses walking past you. A must see if you are on the
                Maryland coast.</p>

        <h2>Ocean City, MD</h2>
        <img src="C:\Users\nicol\lc101\html-me-something\images\20108175_10210317100465923_5352239344271799852_n.jpg" alt="boardwalk" height="600" width="400">
        <p>My favorite beach on the east coast, the beach I visited as a child every summer.
            I was able to bring my family to enjoy <a href="http://ococean.com/">Ocean City, Maryland</a>. We made more sand castles and played in the ocean.
            After we had too much sun, we went to the boardwalk and bought two hermit crabs to bring home. We also purchased salt water taffy from <a href="https://dolles.com/">Dolle's</a>
